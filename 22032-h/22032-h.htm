9</span>THE SHEPHERDESS</h2>
<p>She walks&mdash;the lady of my delight&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A shepherdess of sheep.<br />
Her flocks are thoughts.&nbsp; She keeps them white;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She guards them from the steep.<br />
She feeds them on the fragrant height,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And folds them in for sleep.</p>
<p>She roams maternal hills and bright,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Dark valleys safe and deep.<br />
Into that tender breast at night<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The chastest stars may peep.<br />
She walks&mdash;the lady of my delight&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A shepherdess of sheep.</p>
<p><!-- page 10--><a name="page10"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
10</span>She holds her little thoughts in sight,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Though gay they run and leap.<br />
She is so circumspect and right;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; She has her soul to keep.<br />
She walks&mdash;the lady of my delight&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; A shepherdess of sheep.</p>
<h2><!-- page 11--><a name="page11"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
11</span>&ldquo;I AM THE WAY&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thou art the Way.<br />
Hadst Thou been nothing but the goal,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; I cannot say<br />
If Thou hadst ever met my soul.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot see&mdash;<br />
I, child of process&mdash;if there lies<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; An end for me,<br />
Full of repose, full of replies.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&rsquo;ll not reproach<br
/>
The way that goes, my feet that stir.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Access, approach,<br />
Art Thou, time, way, and wayfarer.</p>
<h2><!-- page 12--><a name="page12"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
12</span>VIA, ET VERITAS, ET VITA</h2>
<p>&ldquo;You never attained to Him?&rdquo;&nbsp; &ldquo;If to
attain<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Be to abide, then that may be.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Endless the way, followed with how much pain!&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;The way was He.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 13--><a name="page13"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
13</span>&ldquo;WHY WILT THOU CHIDE?&rdquo;</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why wilt thou chide,<br />
Who hast attained to be denied?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Oh learn, above<br />
All price is my refusal, Love.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My sacred Nay<br />
Was never cheapened by the way.<br />
Thy single sorrow crowns thee lord<br />
Of an unpurchasable word.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh strong, Oh pure!<br />
As Yea makes happier loves secure,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I vow thee this<br />
Unique rejection of a kiss.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; <!-- page 14--><a name="page14"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 14</span>I guard for thee<br />
This jealous sad monopoly.<br />
I seal this honour thine.&nbsp; None dare<br />

<h2><!-- page 15--><a name="page15"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
15</span>THE LADY POVERTY</h2>
<p>The Lady Poverty was fair:<br />
But she has lost her looks of late,<br />
With change of times and change of air.<br />
Ah slattern, she neglects her hair,<br />
Her gown, her shoes.&nbsp; She keeps no state<br />
As once when her pure feet were bare.</p>
<p>Or&mdash;almost worse, if worse can be&mdash;<br />
She scolds in parlours; dusts and trims,<br />
Watches and counts.&nbsp; Oh, is this she<br />
Whom Francis met, whose step was free,<br />
Who with Obedience carolled hymns,<br />
In Umbria walked with Chastity?</p>
<p><!-- page 16--><a name="page16"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
16</span>Where is her ladyhood?&nbsp; Not here,<br />
Not among modern kinds of men;<br />
But in the stony fields, where clear<br />
Through the thin trees the skies appear;<br />
In delicate spare soil and fen,<br />
And slender landscape and austere.</p>
<h2><!-- page 17--><a name="page17"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
17</span>THE FOLD</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold,<br />
The time is now!&nbsp; Bring back, bring back<br />
Thy flocks of fancies, wild of whim.<br />
Oh lead them from the mountain-track&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thy frolic thoughts untold.<br />
Oh bring them in&mdash;the fields grow dim&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let me be the fold.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Behold,<br />
The time is now!&nbsp; Call in, O call<br />
Thy posturing kisses gone astray<br />
For scattered sweets.&nbsp; Gather them all<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; To shelter from the cold.<br />
Throng them together, close and gay,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; And let me be the fold!</p>
<h2><!-- page 18--><a name="page18"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
18</span>CRADLE-SONG AT TWILIGHT</h2>
<p>The child not yet is lulled to rest.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Too young a nurse, the slender Night<br />
So laxly holds him to her breast<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; That throbs with flight.</p>
<p>He plays with her and will not sleep.<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; For other playfellows she sighs;<br />
An unmaternal fondness keep<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Her alien eyes.</p>
<h2><!-- page 19--><a name="page19"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
19</span>THE ROARING FROST</h2>
<p>A flock of winds came winging from the North,<br />
Strong birds with fighting pinions driving forth<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With a resounding call!</p>
<p>Where will they close their wings and cease their
cries&mdash;<br />
Between what warming seas and conquering skies&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And fold, and fall?</p>
<h2><!-- page 20--><a name="page20"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
20</span>PARENTAGE</h2>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;When Augustus C&aelig;sar legislated
against the unmarried citizens of Rome, he declared them to be,
in some sort, slayers of the people.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah no, not these!<br />
These, who were childless, are not they who gave<br />
So many dead unto the journeying wave,<br />
The helpless nurslings of the cradling seas;<br />
Not they who doomed by infallible decrees<br />
Unnumbered man to the innumerable grave.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- page 21--><a name="page21"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 21</span>But those who slay<br />
Are fathers.&nbsp; Theirs are armies.&nbsp; Death is theirs,<br
/>
The death of innocences and despairs;<br />
The dying of the golden and the grey.<br />
The sentence, when these speak it, has no Nay.<br />
And she who slays is she who bears, who bears.</p>
<h2><!-- page 22--><a name="page22"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
22</span>THE MODERN MOTHER</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh what a kiss<br />
With filial passion overcharged is this!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; To this misgiving breast<br />
The child runs, as a child ne&rsquo;er ran to rest<br />
Upon the light heart and the unoppressed.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unhoped, unsought!<br />
A little tenderness, this mother thought<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The utmost of her meed<br />
She looked for gratitude; content indeed<br />
With thus much that her nine years&rsquo; love had bought.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- page 23--><a name="page23"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 23</span>Nay, even with less.<br />
This mother, giver of life, death, peace, distress,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Desired ah! not so much<br />
Thanks as forgiveness; and the passing touch<br />
Expected, and the slight, the brief caress.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh filial light<br />
Strong in these childish eyes, these new, these bright<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Intelligible stars!&nbsp; Their rays<br />
Are near the constant earth, guides in the maze,<br />
Natural, true, keen in this dusk of days.</p>
<h2><!-- page 24--><a name="page24"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
24</span>WEST WIND IN WINTER</h2>
<p>Another day awakes.&nbsp; And who&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Changing the world&mdash;is this?<br />
He comes at whiles, the Winter through,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; West Wind!&nbsp; I would not miss<br />
His sudden tryst: the long, the new<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Surprises of his kiss.</p>
<p>Vigilant, I make haste to close<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With him who comes my way.<br />
I go to meet him as he goes;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; I know his note, his lay,<br />
His colour and his morning rose;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And I confess his day.</p>
<p><!-- page 25--><a name="page25"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
25</span>My window waits; at dawn I hark<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; His call; at morn I meet<br />
His haste around the tossing park<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And down the softened street;<br />
The gentler light is his; the dark,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The grey&mdash;he turns it sweet.</p>
<p>So too, so too, do I confess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; My poet when he sings.<br />
He rushes on my mortal guess<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With his immortal things.<br />
I feel, I know him.&nbsp; On I press&mdash;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; He finds me &lsquo;twixt his wings.</p>
<h2><!-- page 26--><a name="page26"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
26</span>NOVEMBER BLUE</h2>
<blockquote><p><i>The colour of the electric lights has a strange
effect in giving a complementary tint to the air in the early
evening</i>.&mdash;<span class="smcap">Essay on
London</span>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>O, Heavenly colour!&nbsp; London town<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Has blurred it from her skies;<br />
And hooded in an earthly brown,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unheaven&rsquo;d the city lies.<br />
No longer standard-like this hue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Above the broad road flies;<br />
Nor does the narrow street the blue<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Wear, slender pennon-wise.</p>
<p><!-- page 27--><a name="page27"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
27</span>But when the gold and silver lamps<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Colour the London dew,<br />
And, misted by the winter damps,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The shops shine bright anew&mdash;<br />
Blue comes to earth, it walks the street,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; It dyes the wide air through;<br />
A mimic sky about their feet,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; The throng go crowned with blue.</p>
<h2><!-- page 28--><a name="page28"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
28</span>CHIMES</h2>
<p>Brief, on a flying night,<br />
From the shaken tower,<br />
A flock of bells take flight,<br />
And go with the hour.</p>
<p>Like birds from the cote to the gales,<br />
Abrupt&mdash;O hark!<br />
A fleet of bells set sails,<br />
And go to the dark.</p>
<p>Sudden the cold airs swing.<br />
Alone, aloud,<br />
A verse of bells takes wing<br />
And flies with the cloud.</p>
<h2><!-- page 29--><a name="page29"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
29</span>UNTO US A SON IS GIVEN</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given, not lent,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And not withdrawn&mdash;once sent&mdash;<br />
This Infant of mankind, this One,<br />
Is still the little welcome Son.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;New every year,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; New-born and newly dear,<br />
He comes with tidings and a song,<br />
The ages long, the ages long.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even as the cold<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Keen winter grows not old;<br />
As childhood is so fresh, foreseen,<br />
And spring in the familiar green;</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<!-- page 30--><a
name="page30"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 30</span>Sudden as
sweet<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Come the expected feet.<br />
All joy is young, and new all art,<br />
And He, too, Whom we have by heart.</p>
<h2><!-- page 31--><a name="page31"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
31</span>A DEAD HARVEST<br />
[IN KENSINGTON GARDENS]</h2>
<p>Along the graceless grass of town<br />
They rake the rows of red and brown,<br />
Dead leaves, unlike the rows of hay,<br />
Delicate, neither gold nor grey,<br />
Raked long ago and far away.</p>
<p>A narrow silence in the park;<br />
Between the lights a narrow dark.<br />
One street rolls on the north, and one,<br />
Muffled, upon the south doth run.<br />
Amid the mist the work is done.</p>
<p><!-- page 32--><a name="page32"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
32</span>A futile crop; for it the fire<br />
Smoulders, and, for a stack, a pyre.<br />
So go the town&rsquo;s lives on the breeze,<br />
Even as the sheddings of the trees;<br />
Bosom nor barn is filled with these.</p>
<h2><!-- page 33--><a name="page33"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
33</span>THE TWO POETS</h2>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whose is the speech<br />
That moves the voices of this lonely beech?<br />
Out of the long West did this wild wind come&mdash;<br />
Oh strong and silent!&nbsp; And the tree was dumb,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Ready and dumb, until<br />
The dumb gale struck it on the darkened hill.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two memories,<br />
Two powers, two promises, two silences<br />
Closed in this cry, closed in these thousand leaves<br />
<!-- page 34--><a name="page34"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
34</span>Articulate.&nbsp; This sudden hour retrieves<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The purpose of the past,<br />
Separate, apart&mdash;embraced, embraced at last.</p>
<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&ldquo;Whose is the
word?<br />
Is it I that spake?&nbsp; Is it thou?&nbsp; Is it I that
heard?&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Thine earth was solitary; yet I found thee!&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;Thy sky was pathless, but I caught, I bound thee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou visitant divine.&rdquo;<br />
&ldquo;O thou my Voice, the word was thine.&rdquo;<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; &ldquo;Was thine.&rdquo;</p>
<h2><!-- page 35--><a name="page35"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
35</span>A POET&rsquo;S WIFE</h2>
<p>I saw a tract of ocean locked in-land<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Within a field&rsquo;s embrace&mdash;<br />
The very sea!&nbsp; Afar it fled the strand<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; And gave the seasons chase,<br />
And met the night alone, the tempest spanned,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Saw sunrise face to face.</p>
<p>O Poet, more than ocean, lonelier!<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; In inaccessible rest<br />
And storm remote, thou, sea of thoughts, dost stir,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Scattered through east to west,&mdash;<br />
Now, while thou closest with the kiss of her<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Who locks thee to her breast.</p>
<h2><!-- page 36--><a name="page36"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
36</span>VENERATION OF IMAGES</h2>
<p>Thou man, first-comer, whose wide arms entreat,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Gather, clasp, welcome, bind,<br />
Lack, or remember! whose warm pulses beat<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; With love of thine own kind;</p>
<p>Unlifted for a blessing on yon sea,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Unshrined on this high-way,<br />
O flesh, O grief, thou too shalt have our knee,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Thou rood of every day!</p>
<h2><!-- page 37--><a name="page37"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
37</span>AT NIGHT</h2>
<p>Home, home from the horizon far and clear,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Hither the soft wings sweep;<br />
Flocks of the memories of the day draw near<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; The dovecote doors of sleep.</p>
<p>O which are they that come through sweetest light<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Of all these homing birds?<br />
Which with the straightest and the swiftest flight?<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; Your words to me, your words!</p>

effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
public domain works in creating the Project Gutenberg-tm

"Defects," such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate or

property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or other medium, a

Section  2.  Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of computers
including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers.  It exists
because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations from
people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need, is critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come.  In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future generations.

Section 4.  Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment.  Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States.  Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements.  We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance.  To
SEND DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any
particular state visit http://www.gutenberg.org/fundraising/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States.  U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses.  Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations.

Section 5.  General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic
works.

Professor Michael S. Hart is the originator of the Project Gutenberg-tm
concept of a library of electronic works that could be freely shared
with anyone.  For thirty years, he produced and distributed Project
Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as Public Domain in the U.S.
unless a copyright notice is included.  Thus, we do not necessarily
keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search facility:

     http://www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
